## Conclusions
- Here in this project we performed the Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. After perfoming all the three Regression process. We can conclude that Ridge regression is able to generalize model well as R2 score difference for train and test data is less compared to other two. 
- Important features are present in the Notebook at the end.
